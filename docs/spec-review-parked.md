# Findings parked from `spec-review.md` — pi-loom

_This file collects findings physically removed from the
consolidated spec-review document because they cannot be addressed
by the current `/fix-spec-shape-single-findings` pipeline. Each
entry records the reason for parking and the path to the per-finding
forensic report. Parked findings must be reshaped (typically by
splitting bimodal obligations, narrowing scope, demoting MUSTs,
or capping the prose the fix is allowed to add) before being
re-introduced into the live review document._

_Cascade-parked findings (parked solely because they depended on
another parked finding) typically un-park automatically once the
upstream finding's reshape is re-introduced and successfully fixed,
unless they have substantive shape problems of their own._

## T19d — Populate cancelled-by-session-shutdown details with invocation_id

> **PARKED** — 2026-05-16T17:58:00Z
> **Reason:** The inner spec-diff-fix-loop's severity-weighted triage exited on must-fix-blocked-by-scope-guard (plan §Change A clause 1 escape): a raised lens finding outranked this originating finding in importance, but every viable remediation would violate a class-1 or class-2 scope guard forwarded from the top-level fixer. FIXCOUNTS: none. Loop notes: Classifier early-exited on must-fix-blocked-by-scope-guard with 1 blocked finding (spec-lens-consistency merge of assumptions+consistency+implementability Finding 1: `entry.invocationId` reads in the new prose are unsourceable from the `ActiveInvocationRegistry` contract, which pins only `{loomAbort, disposeBarrier, shutdownReason, loom}` — no `invocationId` member). The originating finding's score S=100 (high importance, must-fix); cumulative sum Σ not computed because the early exit fires before per-pass scoring (n/a / n/a / n/a). The blocking remediations are mutually exhaustive and each foreclosed: adding `invocationId` to the registry entry shape is T19a's owned surface (guard 3); re-deriving at the emission site or via a parallel channel is forbidden by guard 1. T19d is therefore ordering-blocked behind T19a — a human must land T19a (or merge T19a/T19d into a single finding) before T19d can converge. severity p1 raised{high:1} fixed{} deferred{} blocked{high:1} (only the blocking finding was classified; 4 other raised findings remained unclassified per the classifier's "do not classify after early-exit" rule). stage1=0. A human must resolve the guard-vs-severity collision (relax the guard, split this finding so the higher-importance raised finding is no longer downstream of the guard, or accept the trade-off and annotate the raised finding as out-of-scope) before re-introducing this finding.

# T19d — Populate cancelled-by-session-shutdown details with invocation_id

**Kind:** error-model
**Importance:** high
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** single
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The `Per-invocation operator visibility (clean-cancel path)` rule under `id="session-shutdown-semantics"` in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` pins the per-invocation `finally`'s `loom/runtime/cancelled-by-session-shutdown` emission as the teardown-time operator-visibility surface, currently populating `details.event.reason` (read from the registry entry's `shutdownReason`) and `details.event.loom` (read from the registry entry's `loom`). Sibling T19a extends `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entries with an `invocationId` field and sibling T19b adds `invocation_id` to `RuntimeEvent`, but the cleanly-cancelled per-invocation note has no spec rule pinning that `details.event.invocation_id` is populated. Without it, cleanly-cancelled concurrent siblings of the same loom collapse onto the same operator-stream row at teardown even after the registry source and wire field exist. The `loom/runtime/cancelled-by-session-shutdown` row in `docs/spec_topics/diagnostics.md` and the nesting convention under `id="session-shutdown-details-conventions"` in the same file inherit the same gap on the diagnostics-side surface.

## Solution approach

Extend the `Per-invocation operator visibility (clean-cancel path)` rule under `id="session-shutdown-semantics"` in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` to pin that the per-invocation `finally`'s `cancelled-by-session-shutdown` emission populates `details.event.invocation_id` by reading the registry entry's `invocationId` field (the same channel by which `details.event.loom` is read), not by re-deriving an id at the emission site. Mirror the addition in the `loom/runtime/cancelled-by-session-shutdown` row of `docs/spec_topics/diagnostics.md` and in the nesting-convention paragraph under `id="session-shutdown-details-conventions"` in the same file if and only if those locations enumerate the `details.event` field set; otherwise carry no diagnostics-side enumeration drift.

## Solution constraints

- Source `details.event.invocation_id` from the `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry's `invocationId` field on the per-invocation `finally` (the same channel by which `details.event.loom` is read); do not re-derive an id at the emission site and do not introduce a parallel id channel.
- Preserve the existing `details.event.reason` clauses (the `"quit" | "reload" | "new" | "resume" | "fork" | string` type pin, the four captured-value cases under the **Unknown-reason rule**, the `"<unreadable>"` sentinel rules including the post-deadline residual-gap arm) and the `details.event.loom` clause textually unchanged.
- The `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry-shape change, the `RuntimeEvent` wire-field addition, the dedup-key widening, and the real-time timing paragraph are owned by T19a, T19b, T19c, and T19e respectively.
- Do not introduce a new diagnostic code or `details.kind` discriminator.

## Relationships

- T19a "Extend ActiveInvocationRegistry entry shape with invocationId" — co-resolve (this child reads the registry entry T19a defines).
- T19b "Add invocation_id field to RuntimeEvent payload declaration" — co-resolve.
- T19c "Widen always-log dedup key to include invocation_id" — co-resolve.
- T19e "Add real-time sibling emission timing paragraph" — co-resolve.
- T20 "Resource exhaustion under concurrent subagent invocations is undisclaimed for non-memory classes" — same-cluster.
- T18a "Append success-side null-policy paragraph to PIC Runtime event channel" — must-precede.
- T15a "Reduce Session-model Orientation paragraph to a four-sentence forward-linking bullet" — same-cluster.
