# Findings parked from `spec-review.md` — pi-loom

_This file collects findings physically removed from the
consolidated spec-review document because they cannot be addressed
by the current `/fix-spec-shape-single-findings` pipeline. Each
entry records the reason for parking and the path to the per-finding
forensic report. Parked findings must be reshaped (typically by
splitting bimodal obligations, narrowing scope, demoting MUSTs,
or capping the prose the fix is allowed to add) before being
re-introduced into the live review document._

_Cascade-parked findings (parked solely because they depended on
another parked finding) typically un-park automatically once the
upstream finding's reshape is re-introduced and successfully fixed,
unless they have substantive shape problems of their own._

# T19a — Extend ActiveInvocationRegistry entry shape with invocationId

**Kind:** error-model
**Importance:** high
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** multiple
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry shape declared under `id="active-invocation-registry"` in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` carries no per-invocation correlation key — its current `Set<{ loomAbort: AbortController; disposeBarrier: Promise<void>; shutdownReason: string | undefined; loom: string }>` shape lets two concurrent sibling invocations of the same loom be indistinguishable on every downstream operator surface that reads from the registry. Sibling T19b adds an `invocation_id` wire field to `RuntimeEvent`, T19c widens the always-log dedup tuple to include it, and T19d populates `details.event.invocation_id` on the per-invocation `cancelled-by-session-shutdown` emission — all three rely on a canonical registry-side source for the id that does not yet exist. Without a per-entry id minted at registry-insertion time, none of the sibling consumers can populate or dedup on a stable per-invocation discriminator, and same-tick sibling fan-out collapses on every operator surface regardless of how the wire shape evolves.

## Solution approach

Extend the `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry-shape `Set<...>` declaration under `id="active-invocation-registry"` in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` with a required `invocationId: string` member, and pin in the section's contract paragraph that each entry's `invocationId` is sourced via `crypto.randomUUID()` at the registry-insertion site (slash-command handler entry, `tool.execute(...)` adapter entry, and `invoke` spawn-site entry) inside the existing **Dispatch-site setup wrap** `try`/`catch` before any awaitable work, and is set on entry creation and never mutated thereafter. The exact identifier name, type, derivation primitive, and insertion-site placement are the substance of the change and are pinned as part of the registry-shape extension.

## Solution constraints

- Preserve the existing entry-shape members (`loomAbort: AbortController`, `disposeBarrier: Promise<void>`, `shutdownReason: string | undefined`, `loom: string`) verbatim — same name, type, optionality marker, and order.
- Do not introduce a parallel id channel and do not re-derive an id at any downstream emission site; T19c's dedup-key widening and T19d's `details.event.invocation_id` population both depend on a single registry-sourced value.
- The `RuntimeEvent` `invocation_id` wire field, the always-log dedup-tuple widening, the `cancelled-by-session-shutdown` details addition, and the real-time sibling emission-timing paragraph are owned by T19b, T19c, T19d, and T19e respectively.
- Do not introduce a new diagnostic code, `details.kind` discriminator, aggregation surface, or storm-detection layer.

## Relationships

- T19c "Widen always-log dedup key to include invocation_id" — co-resolve.

# T19b — Add invocation_id field to RuntimeEvent payload declaration

**Kind:** error-model
**Importance:** high
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** multiple
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The `type RuntimeEvent = { ... }` declaration in the **Runtime event channel** section of `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md`, introduced by the sentence pinning the shape as "normative and additive-only", carries no per-invocation correlation field. Sibling T19a sources an `invocationId` from the `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry, but the wire payload has no destination for that value, so operator-side consumers of the always-log channel cannot distinguish concurrent-sibling emissions from the same loom. T19c's dedup-key widening and T19d's cancelled-by-session-shutdown details population both read this field and require it to be present on the wire shape.

## Solution approach

Add a required `invocation_id: string` field to the `type RuntimeEvent = { ... }` declaration in the **Runtime event channel** section of `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md`. Rely on the existing "normative and additive-only" sentence above the declaration to characterise the addition; do not re-author that contract note here. Do not edit the surrounding prose, the dedup-tuple statements, or any sibling-owned surface.

## Solution constraints

- Preserve every existing `RuntimeEvent` field (`kind`, `code`, `loom`, `query_site`, `message`, `attempts`, `tokens_used`, `masked`, `occurred_at`) verbatim — same name, type, optionality marker, inline comment, and order.
- The `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry-shape change, the dedup-tuple widening, the cancelled-by-session-shutdown details addition, and the sibling timing paragraph are owned by T19a, T19c, T19d, and T19e respectively.
- Do not introduce a new diagnostic code, `details.kind` discriminator, aggregation surface, or storm-detection layer.

## Relationships

# T19d — Populate cancelled-by-session-shutdown details with invocation_id

**Kind:** error-model
**Importance:** high
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** multiple
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The `Per-invocation operator visibility (clean-cancel path)` rule under `id="session-shutdown-semantics"` in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` pins the per-invocation `finally`'s `loom/runtime/cancelled-by-session-shutdown` emission as the teardown-time operator-visibility surface, currently populating `details.event.reason` (read from the registry entry's `shutdownReason`) and `details.event.loom` (read from the registry entry's `loom`). Sibling T19a extends `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entries with an `invocationId` field and sibling T19b adds `invocation_id` to `RuntimeEvent`, but the cleanly-cancelled per-invocation note has no spec rule pinning that `details.event.invocation_id` is populated. Without it, cleanly-cancelled concurrent siblings of the same loom collapse onto the same operator-stream row at teardown even after the registry source and wire field exist. The `loom/runtime/cancelled-by-session-shutdown` row in `docs/spec_topics/diagnostics.md` and the nesting convention under `id="session-shutdown-details-conventions"` in the same file inherit the same gap on the diagnostics-side surface.

## Solution approach

Extend the `Per-invocation operator visibility (clean-cancel path)` rule under `id="session-shutdown-semantics"` in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` to pin that the per-invocation `finally`'s `cancelled-by-session-shutdown` emission populates `details.event.invocation_id` by reading the registry entry's `invocationId` field (the same channel by which `details.event.loom` is read), not by re-deriving an id at the emission site. Mirror the addition in the `loom/runtime/cancelled-by-session-shutdown` row of `docs/spec_topics/diagnostics.md` and in the nesting-convention paragraph under `id="session-shutdown-details-conventions"` in the same file if and only if those locations enumerate the `details.event` field set; otherwise carry no diagnostics-side enumeration drift.

## Solution constraints

- Source `details.event.invocation_id` from the `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry's `invocationId` field on the per-invocation `finally` (the same channel by which `details.event.loom` is read); do not re-derive an id at the emission site and do not introduce a parallel id channel.
- Preserve the existing `details.event.reason` clauses (the `"quit" | "reload" | "new" | "resume" | "fork" | string` type pin, the four captured-value cases under the **Unknown-reason rule**, the `"<unreadable>"` sentinel rules including the post-deadline residual-gap arm) and the `details.event.loom` clause textually unchanged.
- The `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry-shape change, the `RuntimeEvent` wire-field addition, the dedup-key widening, and the real-time timing paragraph are owned by T19a, T19b, T19c, and T19e respectively.
- Do not introduce a new diagnostic code or `details.kind` discriminator.

## Relationships

- T19b "Add invocation_id field to RuntimeEvent payload declaration" — co-resolve.

# T19e — Add real-time sibling emission timing paragraph

**Kind:** error-model
**Importance:** high
**Atomicity:** atomic
**Shape:** multiple
**State:** reduced

## Problem

The **Runtime event channel** section in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` pins exactly-once-per-origin emission semantics for `loom-system-note` always-log notes and lists Deduplication and lifetime rules, but does not pin emission timing across concurrent sibling invocations. An implementer reading the section could legally batch sibling always-log emissions until the parent's tool-loop round closes — deferring operator-visible failure timing — without violating any existing rule on the page. The omission also leaves V18q's concurrent-sibling emission tests without a normative anchor for whether sibling failures must surface in real time at the originating site.

## Solution approach

Extend the **Runtime event channel** section in `docs/spec_topics/pi-integration-contract.md` to pin the emission timing of sibling always-log notes on `loom-system-note`. The section must establish that each sibling emission surfaces in real time at its originating site (batching across the parent's tool-loop round is not permitted), with V18q's concurrent-sibling tests as the binding behavioural anchor. The relative interleaving order across concurrent sibling origins follows the host JavaScript runtime's event-loop scheduling and is operator-observable; no test asserts a specific cross-sibling interleaving sequence.

## Solution constraints

- Do not relocate or reword the existing paragraphs in the section.
- The `ActiveInvocationRegistry` entry-shape change, the `RuntimeEvent` `invocation_id` wire field, the dedup-key widening, and the cancelled-by-session-shutdown details change are owned by T19a, T19b, T19c, and T19d respectively.
