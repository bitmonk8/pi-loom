# T01 — "Sequential by default" omits the CLAUDE.md "Never block the async runtime" obligation

**Original heading:** "Sequential by default" omits CLAUDE.md "Never block the async runtime"
**Original section:** docs/plan_topics/conventions.md
**Kind:** doc-alignment-broad
**Importance:** medium
**Score:** 20
**MustFix:** false

## Finding

The project-level CLAUDE.md concurrency directive has two halves: *"Sequential by default"* and *"Never block the async runtime."* `conventions.md` adopts the first half verbatim as a cross-cutting rule, but that rule is scoped entirely to Promise-combinator concurrency — it forbids `Promise.all` / `Promise.race` / `Promise.allSettled` / `Promise.any` in `src/**` and defines the allow-list / closing-gate predicate for them. Nowhere in the plan corpus is the complementary half stated: synchronous blocking of the event loop (`fs.readFileSync`, `execSync`, busy-wait loops) is neither banned nor mentioned. A `grep` of the entire plan corpus for `readFileSync`, `execSync`, `busy-wait`, and `block`/`blocking` returns no hits.

This matters because the loom interpreter runs as plain async TypeScript on Pi's shared event loop (`spec_topics/implementation-notes.md` — "non-blocking at the runtime level, sequential at the language level"; "The loom interpreter runs as plain async TypeScript on Pi's event loop"). A synchronous blocking call in `src/**` would stall the host event loop for every concurrent invocation, which is exactly the failure the CLAUDE.md "Never block the async runtime" directive guards against — yet an implementer reading only the plan's "Sequential by default" rule sees only the Promise-combinator ban and has no documentary surface reminding them of the blocking-call prohibition.

The omission is also an enforcement-posture gap: the `no-restricted-syntax` lint wired by `H2a` matches only the four Promise-combinator forms. Blocking synchronous calls are not lint-detectable by that rule, so the blocking-runtime ban — even once stated — would carry no mechanical gate and would rest on the seam-adapter discipline (I/O routed through the `V8*` FileSystem seam) plus the Per-phase TDD ritual self-review step. The plan should state both the obligation and that it is unenforced mechanically.

## Plan Documents

- `docs/plan_topics/conventions.md` — *Sequential by default* cross-cutting rule; *Per-phase TDD ritual* self-review step (edited)
- `docs/plan_topics/H2a-cross-cutting-gates.md` — Convention / Tests bullet for *Sequential by default* (read-only) — confirms the `no-restricted-syntax` lint scope is Promise-combinators only

## Spec Documents

None

(`spec_topics/implementation-notes.md` grounds the "runs on Pi's event loop / non-blocking at the runtime level" property the fix cites, but the fix is internal to the plan and edits no spec page.)

## Affected Leaves

**Phases:** None

**Leaves (implementation order):**

None

(Cross-cutting `conventions.md` doc-alignment fix. `H2a`'s lint scope is unchanged — the blocking-call ban is explicitly non-lint-detectable — so no leaf's acceptance criteria, Deps, or sequencing change.)

## Consequence

**Severity:** advisory

An implementer following only the plan corpus has no statement of the blocking-runtime prohibition; a `fs.readFileSync` / `execSync` / busy-wait in `src/**` would stall Pi's shared event loop for all concurrent invocations, and neither the `no-restricted-syntax` lint nor any closing-gate check would catch it. Implementers can still produce working leaves (the seam-adapter discipline routes I/O off the blocking path), so this is a guidance gap rather than a hard blocker.

## Issue introduction

**Verdict:** present-since-inception
**Introducing commits:** `288f191` (2026-05-04) — "Add implementation plan with horizontal/MVP/vertical-slice phases"
**History:** The *Sequential by default* rule entered the corpus in `288f191` (then in the single-file `plan.md`) scoped to Promise-combinators only, and carried unchanged through the per-topic split (`fecb504`) into `conventions.md` and the `docs/` move (`31ff060`). `git log -S "Never block the async"`, `git log -S "readFileSync" -- docs/`, and `git log -S "execSync" -- docs/` show the blocking-runtime ban has never appeared in the plan corpus. The gap is original to the rule's authoring, not introduced by a later edit.

## Solution Space

**Shape:** single

### Recommendation

Append to the *Sequential by default* cross-cutting rule in `docs/plan_topics/conventions.md` text stating that the rule subsumes the CLAUDE.md *"Never block the async runtime"* directive: synchronous blocking of the event loop in `src/**` (e.g. `fs.readFileSync`, `execSync`, busy-wait loops) is forbidden because the interpreter runs on Pi's shared event loop (cross-reference `spec_topics/implementation-notes.md`). State the enforcement posture explicitly: this half carries **no mechanical gate** — the `no-restricted-syntax` rule wired by `H2a` matches only the Promise-combinator forms — so the blocking-call ban is enforced by the seam-adapter discipline (file/process I/O routed through the `V8*` FileSystem seam) and the *Per-phase TDD ritual* self-review step.

Add a blocking-call check to the self-review enumeration in the *Per-phase TDD ritual* (the bullet that already enumerates the broad-catch, globals, and ambient-primitive checks), so the manual residue this ban concedes has a named review home — mirroring how the *No globals* and ambient-access rules route their non-mechanical residue to the same self-review step.
