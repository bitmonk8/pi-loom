## Problem

Two sibling governance retirement tables carry literal placeholder strings in their `Retired in` columns instead of concrete commit SHAs or release tags, violating each table's stated column-value contract. The Retired REQ-IDs sub-table at `docs/spec_topics/governance/anchor-scheme-and-retired.md` (anchor `id="retired-req-ids"`) lists GOV-2, GOV-4, GOV-10, and GOV-11 with the literal `<retirement commit>` placeholder; only GOV-13 carries a concrete SHA. The Retired prefixes sub-table at `docs/spec_topics/governance/req-id-prefix-table-retired.md` carries the literal `<demotion commit>` in its `PIE` row. The placeholders were meant to be overwritten at retirement/demotion time but shipped unresolved, so the only surviving evidence of retirement is the row's presence, and any tooling validating the `Retired in` columns rejects four of five REQ-ID rows and the lone `PIE` row.

## Solution approach

Backfill each placeholder cell with the abbreviated commit SHA of the historical commit that performed the retirement/demotion, following the GOV-13 row's format; the retiring commits are recoverable via git history on each retirement-row's text. Resolve the `PIE` row in `req-id-prefix-table-retired.md`: backfill its SHA when the demoting commit is in history, otherwise land the demotion first or remove the row until the demotion is performed. When the `PIE` cell is backfilled, also strip the now-dangling `<demotion commit>` parenthetical in that section's column-contract paragraph.

## Solution constraints

- Each backfilled value MUST be the SHA of the historical commit that performed the retirement/demotion, never the SHA of the repair commit that backfills the cell.

## Relationships

None
