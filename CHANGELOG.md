# Changelog

All notable changes to `@bitmonk8/pi-theta` will be documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-19

### Changed

- **Ported to the Pi SDK 0.80.x API.** Bumped `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`,
  `pi-agent-core`, `pi-ai`, and `pi-tui` to `0.80.10` and adapted the runtime and
  test harnesses to the reshaped SDK surface:
  - `complete` is now imported from the `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat` subpath
    (it moved off the package root in 0.80.x).
  - `createAgentSession` model/auth wiring migrated from the removed
    `modelRegistry` / `authStorage` options to `modelRuntime`
    (`ModelRuntime.create()`); `ModelRegistry` is now built via
    `new ModelRegistry(runtime)` (the static `.create()` factory was removed).
- **Split the SDK dependency-range convention.** `devDependencies` are pinned to
  the build/test target `~0.80.10`; `peerDependencies` now declare an open floor
  (see Breaking) instead of a single shared tilde range. Updated the `#pi-sdk-pin`
  contract (PIC-33/PIC-34, the manifest lock-step, and the "Deliberate deviation"
  rationale) to describe the peer-floor / dev-pin split.

### Breaking

- **Raised the minimum supported Pi version to `>=0.80.8`.** `peerDependencies`
  moved from `~0.75.5` to `>=0.80.8` — the earliest release in which every SDK
  API shape the runtime requires exists. Hosts on Pi `< 0.80.8` are no longer
  supported and are rejected by the runtime peer-dependency probe.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-19

### Changed

- **Renamed the project Loom → Theta** (named after Turing's fixed-point
  combinator, Θ), to resolve a package-name collision with an unrelated
  `pi-loom`. This is a breaking rename across every surface:
  - Package `@bitmonk8/pi-loom` → `@bitmonk8/pi-theta` (published as `0.2.0`).
  - File extensions `.loom` → `.theta` (programs), `.warp` → `.thetalib`
    (library modules).
  - CLI flag `--loom` → `--theta` (hard rename, no alias).
  - Discovery/settings/manifest surfaces `~/.pi/agent/looms/` →
    `~/.pi/agent/theta/`, `.pi/looms/` → `.pi/theta/`, `loomPaths` →
    `thetaPaths`, `pi.looms` → `pi.theta`, `looms.*` settings → `theta.*`.
    Old names are not honoured; an old-named dir/key surfaces a one-shot
    deprecation diagnostic.
  - Diagnostic-code prefix `loom/*` → `theta/*` (suffixes unchanged, except
    those naming the old extension, e.g. `import-non-warp-extension` →
    `import-non-thetalib-extension`).
  - Runtime identifiers `Loom*` → `Theta*`, `Warp*` → `ThetaLib*`.
  - Release-version literal `loom X.Y` → `theta X.Y`; governance anchors
    `loom-1-0-*` → `theta-1-0-*`.
  - Retired the legacy `v1-*` HTML-anchor dual-anchor governance machinery
    (GOV-25–GOV-29) wholesale, repointing all inbound `#v1-*` cross-references
    to their `theta-1-0-*` canonical arms.
  - See [`docs/rename-to-theta.md`](docs/rename-to-theta.md) for the full plan.
